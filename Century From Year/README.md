# Instructions

Given a year, return the century it is in.

The first century spans from the year 1 up to and including the year 100,
the second - from the year 101 up to and including the year 200, etc.

Let's see some examples:

```go
centuryFromYear(1705) // returns 18
centuryFromYear(1900) // returns 19
centuryFromYear(1601) // returns 17
centuryFromYear(2000) // returns 20
````

Hope you enjoy it .. Awaiting for Best Practice Codes hahaha ..

Enjoy Learning !!!

NOTE: for C, C++ and JS, `cmath` (i.e. `math.h`) is disallowed in this Kata, in particular the `ceil` function; otherwise, what is the fun of this Kata? ;)
